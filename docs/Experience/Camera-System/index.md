# :lucide-video: Camera System

**Period:** 2016 – 2018  
**Scope:** Camera Electro-Optical Systems  
**Tools:** MATLAB  

## Overview

Worked on low-level camera imaging pipeline and electro-optical system components, focusing on **image quality optimization**, **sensor calibration**, and **real-time processing algorithms**.

This role built the foundation for later work in computer vision and deep learning by developing a strong understanding of:

* sensor physics
* image signal processing (ISP)
* noise modeling and correction
* performance optimization under hardware constraints
