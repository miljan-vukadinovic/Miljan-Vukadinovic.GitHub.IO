# :lucide-bot-message-square: AI Service SaaS

A web-based AI platform for interacting with **multimodal AI services** through a unified chat interface.

> Focus: **chat-first access to intelligent services** — personas, translation, and data interaction


## 🚀 Overview

This is a **full-stack AI SaaS application** that provides users with a conversational interface to access multiple AI-powered services.

It integrates **LLMs, voice/video processing, and data pipelines** into a single platform, enabling seamless interaction across different modalities.


## 🧠 Core Features

### 💬 Chat Interface
- Chat-based interaction (ChatGPT-style UX)
- Multi-turn conversation with context awareness
- Streaming responses (low-latency UX)


### 🧑 Personas (Conversational AI)
Interact with specialized AI personas:

- Professionals (consultants, advisors, engineers)
- Companions (casual conversation, emotional support)
- Custom personalities with tone/style control

**Capabilities**

- Text and voice messaging
- Real-time voice/video call support (planned)
- Memory-aware conversations


### 🌐 Live Translator
Real-time multilingual communication:

- Text ↔ Text translation  
- Voice ↔ Voice translation  
- Video call translation (subtitles / dubbing)

**Features**

- Multiple voice styles
- Low-latency streaming translation
- Context-aware translation (tone preservation)


### 📄 Chat with Data (RAG System)
Interact with structured and unstructured data:

**Supported formats**:

  - PDF, DOC, XLS, CSV
  - Websites / URLs
  - General web knowledge

**Capabilities**

- Document ingestion & parsing
