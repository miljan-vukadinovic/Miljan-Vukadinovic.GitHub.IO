# :lucide-bot: Personal AI Assistant

A desktop-based AI assistant for **real-world task execution and productivity**, built as a lightweight agent system with controlled autonomy.

> Focus: **action-oriented AI** — execute tasks, assist workflows, and integrate with daily tools


## 🚀 Overview

The Personal AI Assistant is a **desktop application** designed to bring AI capabilities directly into the user’s operating system.

Unlike chat-based systems, it focuses on **task execution and workflow assistance**, enabling users to automate real-world activities such as communication and scheduling.

This system is intentionally designed to be:
- **Narrow in scope**
- **Controlled in behavior**
- **Reliable for daily use**


## 🧠 Core Features

### 📧 Email Agent
Automates email-related workflows:

- Read and summarize incoming emails
- Generate replies based on context
- Draft emails with tone/style control
- Categorize and prioritize messages


### 📞 Voice Call Agent
AI-assisted voice communication:

- Outgoing call support (scripted / AI-assisted)
- Incoming call handling (assistive mode)
- Real-time transcription
- Response suggestion / guided conversation


### 🎙️ Voice Interaction
Voice-first interface for natural interaction:

- Speech-to-Text (STT) for commands
- Text-to-Speech (TTS) for responses
- Low-latency interaction loop


### ⚙️ Task Assistance
Lightweight automation for daily workflows:

- Scheduling and reminders
- Quick information retrieval
- Context-aware assistance
- Integration with external services (extensible)


## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Desktop Application
- ElectronJS (cross-platform desktop app)
- Local UI for interaction and control
- Background processes for continuous operation


### AI Engine
- LLM APIs:
  - OpenAI
  - Anthropic
  - Google AI

- Orchestration:
  - PydanticAI (structured agent workflows)


### Communication Layer
- API / WebSocket integration with backend services (e.g., SANAI)
- Streaming support for real-time interaction


### Local Capabilities
- System-level access (controlled scope)
- File system interaction (optional / extensible)
- Local state management (user preferences, session data)


## 🔄 Core Workflows

### 1. Voice Command → Task Execution
```

User Voice → STT → Intent Parsing → Agent Execution → Response (TTS/UI)

```


### 2. Email Automation
```

Inbox → AI Processing → Summary / Draft → User Approval → Send

```


### 3. Voice Call Assistance
```

Call Audio → Transcription → Context Analysis → Suggested Response

```


## 🎯 Design Principles
